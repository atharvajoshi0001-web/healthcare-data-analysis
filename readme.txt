
## Tools Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Disease-wise patient count
4. Average treatment cost analysis
5. Average hospital stay by disease
6. Gender-wise cost analysis
7. Data visualization using bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and violin plots

## Visualizations
- **Bar Plots:** Disease-wise patient count, average cost, average age  
- **Pie Charts:** Gender distribution, patient distribution by disease  
- **Scatter Plots:** Age vs Treatment Cost, Hospital Stay vs Treatment Cost  
- **Box/Violin Plots:** Hospital stay distribution by disease  

## Key Insights
- Heart Disease patients have highest treatment cost and longest hospital stay
- Diabetes patients are more common in older age groups
- Gender-wise differences in treatment cost observed
- Longer hospital stays correlate with higher treatment costs
